Heavily inspired by [Coming Out Simulator 2014](https://github.com/ncase/coming-out-simulator-2014), I invite you to a journey through my own experience. You were (I still am) a college student, and it was near the end of a semester. You were just another crazy kid taking one test and another - so ready for the summer vacation...
